Nubra Product Intern — Submission

Hi Nubra Team,

I explored Nubra (nubra.io) and built a working demo that helps traders simulate a multi‑monitor workspace in the browser. This submission includes:
- UI/UX suggestions specific to Nubra’s website & terminal
- A concise competitor analysis (backtesting and algo platforms)
- A bridge feature proposal to help manual traders adopt algorithmic trading
- Wireframes and flows for the proposed feature and the multi‑screen workspace
- Live demo and source links

1) Executive Summary
Manual traders love context density and speed, often using 4–8 physical screens to watch charts, options, scanners, and news. I built a browser‑based “Multi‑Screen Workspace” so traders can compose an 6–8 panel layout (ultrawide + secondary screens), each with an independent chart or data view, and interact with charts directly.

This aligns with Nubra’s “Trade Instantly from Charts” and “Complete Options Suite” positioning by:
- Concentrating critical views together (chart + option chain + scanners + baskets) without tabbing
- Preserving muscle memory via fixed transforms and deterministic layout
- Low friction to adopt: no device changes, just a web link

---

2) UI/UX Suggestions for Nubra
These are focused, low‑risk improvements that reinforce speed, clarity, and conversion.

A. Home & Onboarding
- Clear primary CTA hierarchy: Make “Open Account” consistently primary; keep “Download App” secondary.
- One‑liner value proposition above the fold: “Trade options faster: Chart → Tap → Trade. Multi‑leg spreads in one click.”
- Social proof density: Add lightweight metrics near hero (active traders, average order execution time, options lots/day). Keep them scannable.
- Onboarding strip: Keep the “Onboard in 3 Easy Steps” but add microcopy under each step with realistic expectations (e.g., "KYC in ~5 min").

B. Navigation & Information Scent
- Reduce repetition in the features carousel; ensure each tile is unique (Flexi Basket appears multiple times).
- Expose “APIs” and “Backtesting” (if available/roadmap) in the Products dropdown to attract quant users.
- Add an always‑visible “Status” link (uptime) to boost trust for active traders.

C. Terminal UX (Web)
- Persistent action shelf on the chart: buttons for Buy/Sell, Options Builder, Basket, and “Record Playbook”.
- Multi‑pane layouts: Save/Load named layouts (2×2, 3×2, 3×3) with remembered data sources.
- Power keyboard: Go‑to (/) for stock search; “.” to switch pane focus; “F” for one‑click basket; “Shift+C” to clone pane.
- Visual feedback: When placing orders from chart, show bracket trails/TP/SL in‑chart with drag handles.

D. Performance & Perception
- Lazy load heavy modules below the fold; prioritize LCP on hero chart/text.
- Keep CSS/JS payload sizes under thresholds; defer non‑critical libraries.
- Add small skeleton loaders for chart & option chain for perceived speed.

3) Competitor Analysis: Backtesting & Algo Platforms

| Platform | Strengths | Gaps | What Nubra can borrow |
|---|---|---|---|
| TradingView | Best‑in‑class charting; Pine Script; giant community; backtesting on chart | Limited broker‑neutral live algo; Pinescript onboarding still technical | “Record from chart” + no‑code playbooks; crowd templates |
| Zerodha Streak | No‑code strategies; easy deploy to broker | Limited indicator breadth vs TV; India‑focused | Simple, opinionated strategy wizard + broker‑native deploy |
| QuantConnect | Institutional feeds; Lean engine; multi‑asset | Steep learning curve; complex cloud setup | Offer a guided path from “Record → Script” with examples |
| Tradetron | Visual strategy builder; marketplace | UX clutter; debugging complexity | Clean visual builder + inline simulation/PNL overlays |
| Amibroker | Extremely fast backtests; AFL | Desktop only; dated UX | Performance‑first backtesting backend surfaced in modern UI |
| MT5 | Huge retail base; EAs | Windows‑centric; MQL learning curve | Bridge scripts from recorded actions to MQL‑like low code |

Key takeaway: winning platforms reduce time‑to‑first‑strategy and increase confidence with tight feedback (visual PnL, bar‑by‑bar playback). Nubra can differentiate by blending chart‑first recording with no‑code strategy assembly.

4) Bridge Feature: “Record & Recommend” → No‑Code Strategy
Goal: Help manual traders become algo traders in hours, not weeks.

- Record Mode (Chart):
  - User toggles “Record Playbook” on any chart pane.
  - We capture interactions: symbol, timeframe, indicators in view, clicks (breakouts, pullbacks), entry/exit points, SL/TP adjustments.
  - Auto‑extract features: moving averages slopes, RSI zones, candle patterns near clicks, volatility state.

- Recommend Mode:
  - After a few sessions, surface 1–2 “Detected Playbooks” with confidence (e.g., “Pullback‑to‑20EMA after volume expansion”).
  - Show sample trades + metrics: win rate, avg R:R, drawdown, best/worst day.

- One‑click “Make it a Strategy” (No‑Code):
  - Pre‑filled blocks: Entry Condition(s), Filters, Risk (SL as ATR x), Exit (TP/Trail), Session filter.
  - Backtest inline on a year of data; show intuitive overlays on chart.

- Deploy:
  - Paper trade → alerts → semi‑auto → auto (with guardrails like max loss/day).

- Guardrails:
  - Overfitting check, walk‑forward validation, OOS performance badge, and “data snooping” warnings.

- Success Metrics:
  - TTFX (time to first executable strategy), paper‑to‑live conversion rate, 30‑day retention, drawdown discipline adherence.

5) Multi‑Screen Workspace (What I built)
Live demo: https://virtual-9po63dg12-sujiths-projects-a37dec73.vercel.app  
Source: https://github.com/mvsujith/virtual-lab

- Compose 6–8 screen layouts inside the browser (ultrawide + standard monitors).
- Each screen can host independent charts and data modules.
- Deterministic, fixed transforms for consistent spatial memory.
- Interactive chart on ultrawide screen (pan/zoom independent of camera).
- Persistently hide certain monitors; restore via console helpers.
- Default camera view set for clarity; UI kept minimal (“pointer on charts to interact”).

Why it matters:
- Traders retain the benefits of multi‑monitor workflows on a laptop or single ultrawide.
- Faster situational awareness (watchlist + chart + option chain + news + positions)
- Seamless handoff to “Record & Recommend” buttons on each pane.

6) Wireframes (Text)

A. Multi‑Screen Workspace
- Header: Symbol search (/) • Layout presets (2×2, 3×2, 3×3) • Save Layout • Help
- Canvas: 3D staged monitors; click pane → focus; wheel over pane zooms chart only
- Pane menu: Replace Data • Duplicate Pane • Send to Basket • Record Playbook
- Status bar: Connection • Latency • Paper/Live toggle

B. Record & Recommend → No‑Code Strategy
1) Chart: toggle [Record] → user trades/mocks trades as usual
2) Right drawer: Live capture of interactions + inferred features
3) After session: “Detected Playbooks” card with metrics + [Make Strategy]
4) No‑Code Builder: blocks auto‑filled → [Backtest] on sample period → PnL overlay
5) Deploy panel: Paper → Alerts → Semi‑Auto → Auto with guardrails

---

7) Rollout Plan
- Phase 1 (2–4 weeks): Multi‑screen layout, pane management, saved layouts
- Phase 2 (4–6 weeks): Recording layer + lightweight recommendations
- Phase 3 (6–10 weeks): No‑code builder + backtest + deploy + guardrails

Dependencies: Charting SDK (TV), backtest engine, auth/session, broker APIs.

8) Closing
I’m excited about Nubra’s focus on options and speed. This submission shows how we can reduce cognitive load for active traders and make the journey from manual → algo natural and fun.

Happy to walk through the demo live and iterate on the feature design.
