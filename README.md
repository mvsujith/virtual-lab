Nubra Product Intern — Submission


1) Executive Summary
Manual traders love context density and speed, often using 4–8 physical screens to watch charts, options, scanners, and news. I built a browser‑based “Multi‑Screen Workspace” so traders can compose an 6–8 panel layout (ultrawide + secondary screens), each with an independent chart or data view, and interact with charts directly.

This aligns with Nubra’s “Trade Instantly from Charts” and “Complete Options Suite” positioning by:
- Concentrating critical views together (chart + option chain + scanners + baskets) without tabbing
- Preserving muscle memory via fixed transforms and deterministic layout
- Low friction to adopt: no device changes, just a web link

2) Multi‑Screen Workspace (What I built)
Live demo: https://multi-screens.onrender.com/  
Source: https://github.com/mvsujith/virtual-lab

- Compose 6–8 screen layouts inside the browser (ultrawide + standard monitors).
- Each screen can host independent charts and data modules.
- Deterministic, fixed transforms for consistent spatial memory.
- Interactive chart on ultrawide screen (pan/zoom independent of camera).
- Persistently hide certain monitors; restore via console helpers.
- Default camera view set for clarity; UI kept minimal (“pointer on charts to interact”).

Why it matters:
- Traders retain the benefits of multi‑monitor workflows on a laptop or single ultrawide.
- Faster situational awareness (watchlist + chart + option chain + news + positions)
- Seamless handoff to “Record & Recommend” buttons on each pane.

3) Closing
I’m excited about Nubra’s focus on options and speed. This submission shows how we can reduce cognitive load for active traders and make the journey from manual → algo natural and fun.

Happy to walk through the demo live and iterate on the feature design.
